# Fertility histories in four British cohort studies

[Centre for Longitudinal Studies](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/)

---

## Overview
This repository provides Stata code that harmonises fertility variables in four British cohort studies:

•	1946 MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)

•	1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS)

•	1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)

•	1989/1990 Next Steps

There is a code file for each cohort study. The derived data has been deposited with the [**UK Data Service**](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9418). The code enables researchers to track how the data have been derived as well as to adapt the code for their own use such as deriving additional variables.

## Included variable domains

| Domain         | Variables                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Fertility      | biologial children (whether has any, number, number of girls and boys, age of eldest and youngest, number of children with a previous partner, number living in household, number living outside household )             |
|                |  non-biological (whether has any, number, number of girls and boys, age of eldest and youngest)   |
|Partnership           |  whether partner in houshold, marital status   |

Further details about the variables and can be found in the user guide for the deposited data which can be found here [online link to guide to be inserted when on CLS website].

## Syntax and data availability
- *Source data:* Download raw data for NCDS, BCS70, and Next Steps from the  [**UK Data Service**](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/). For the NSHD raw data should be requested from [**MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL (LHA)**](https://skylark.ucl.ac.uk/NSHD/data). See the the Stata code for NSHD for the variables to be requested. Place all raw data files in a folder on your computer.
  
- *Syntax:* Each of the code files (one for each cohorts) reads those data files and produces the datasets.    
- *Derived datasets:* Available to download from the [**UK Data Service**](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9418).
